    <p>Ramen has taken the western world by storm, but what is this dish and what has led to it being so popular all across the world?</p>

    <p>Simply put, ramen is a Japanese noodle soup, with a combination of a rich flavoured broth, one of a variety of types of noodle and a 
        selection of meats or vegetables, often topped with a boiled egg.</p>

        In Japan ramen is considered a fast food, with many small restaurants and street vendors offering a warming bowl of this delicious soup.
